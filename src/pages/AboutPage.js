              In the charming French countryside, Rustic Root, an online
              furniture shop, flourished for 20 years. Founded in 2003 by
              Am√©lie, a furniture enthusiast, it curated rustic pieces that
              exuded the essence of French elegance. Initially facing
              challenges, Rustic Root's commitment to quality attracted
              customers worldwide.
